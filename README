OPTIONS/SOURCE:

The source is fairly simple, and there are plenty of options to go around.
I don't do much source commenting, but it is all fairly self explanitory.

compiling without make:gcc -Wall -g -O2 mocicon.c -o mocicon `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0`

with make it is the regular as root:

Make clean install

it's simple enough. you'll need the gtk+ 2.0 libs and that's it.


run ./install as root. it just installs mocicon in /usr/local/bin/
